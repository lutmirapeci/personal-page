              My journey began with a deep love for mathematics, which I've been
              teaching as a self-employed tutor since 2017. In 2021, I took a
              transformative step by diving into Python and web development
              courses. That's when I discovered my passion for frontend
              development ‚Äî blending üß† logic, üé® creativity, and üñåÔ∏è design into
              one powerful field.
            </p>

              I've spent nearly two years working professionally as a ReactJS
              developer, building intuitive, user-focused interfaces and gaining
              hands-on experience in modern frontend practices. After welcoming
              my wonderful daughter Emma into the world, I took a brief career
              pause to focus on motherhood ‚Äî an experience that has brought even
              more determination and perspective to my work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
              Over the past year, I've dedicated myself to refining my skills,
              growing my portfolio, and preparing to re-enter the professional
              space. This website is more than a portfolio ‚Äî it's a showcase of
              my passion, resilience, and commitment to delivering exceptional
              user experiences.
